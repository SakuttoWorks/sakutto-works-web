# SakuttoWorks: Agentic Economy & MCP Ecosystem

## Overview
Expert AI Software Architect & Technical Co-founder. Developing **Agent-Commerce-OS**, a production-ready BaaS (Backend-as-a-Service) framework optimized for autonomous monetization and AI agent tool execution.

## Flagship Project: Project GHOST SHIP (MCP Server)
### Description
A high-performance, monetized MCP (Model Context Protocol) gateway utilizing a Hybrid Edge-Core architecture. Designed to bridge the gap between conversational LLMs and autonomous economic actions.

### Hybrid Architecture (2026 Edition)
- **Layer A: The Intelligent Edge (agent-commerce-gateway)**
  - Low-latency SSE/MCP aggregation on Cloudflare Workers.
  - **Agent-aware Auth**: Real-time rate limiting and billing validation via Polar.sh.
  - Implements Zero-Trust security and A2A (Agent-to-Agent) logging.
- **Layer B: The Agentic Factory (agent-commerce-core)**
  - Heavy compute and deep research using Python 3.13+ and FastAPI on Google Cloud Run.
  - LLM-native Markdown generation via Jina Reader and Firecrawl.
- **Layer C: The Universal Vault (Supabase / R2)**
  - Long-term memory via pgvector and durable cold storage for agent logs.

### Usage & Endpoints
- **Base URL**: `https://api.sakutto.works/`
- **MCP Endpoint**: `https://api.sakutto.works/mcp/`
- **REST Endpoint**: `https://api.sakutto.works/rapidapi/`
- **Protocol**: MCP over SSE / REST JSON.

### Tools
- `search_data`: Autonomous deep-web research tool. Returns structured, RAG-optimized data.
- `market_analytics`: One-click financial data analysis and automated visualization.
- `get_status`: Real-time operational status and latency metrics of the infrastructure.

### Access & Monetization
- **Agent Tier (A2A)**: Direct MCP connection with Metered Billing via **Polar.sh**.
- **Developer Tier (B2B)**: Legacy REST integration via **RapidAPI**.
- **Direct Purchase**: [Lemon Squeezy Store](https://sakuttoworks.lemonsqueezy.com/)
